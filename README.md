# Hip Fracture Risk – Logistic Regression (R)

This project investigates the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and
hip fracture risk using logistic regression in R.

## Project Overview
Hip fracture is a significant clinical outcome associated with osteoporosis and
reduced bone strength. This analysis explores whether BMD is a meaningful predictor
of hip fracture probability.

## Data & Methods
- Outcome variable: Hip fracture (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Predictor: Bone mineral density (BMD)
- Exploratory data analysis using boxplots
- Logistic regression modelling to estimate fracture probability
- Model predictions visualised across the BMD range

## Key Findings
- Patients with hip fractures show consistently lower BMD values
- Logistic regression indicates an inverse relationship between BMD and fracture risk
- Predicted probability of fracture increases as BMD decreases

## Tools Used
- R
- Logistic regression
- Statistical modelling
- Data visualisation
